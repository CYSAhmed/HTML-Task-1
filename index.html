            Gon Freecss is an athletic, naïve, and friendly boy, raised on Whale Island by his aunt Mito. Gon spent much time in the woods as a child, endowing him with heightened senses and an affinity for animals. A chance encounter with the Hunter Kite, the disciple of Gon's father Ging, inspires him to become a Hunter himself in order to find Ging. During the Hunter Exam, Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight while being antagonised by the magician Hisoka. After successfully becoming a licensed Hunter, Gon and Killua learn about Nen from Wing and later train and competes in a tournament test his new powers against Hisoka.[ch. 47, 48, 137] Gon's Nen type is Enhancement, which gives him his great strength and recuperative abilities.[ch. 60] Although Gon loses the match, he repays a debt to Hisoka for helping him pass the Hunter Exam. Both Gon and Killua return to the former's homeland to greet Mito, who reveals to him a recorded message from Ging that interests Gon in trying his Greed Island video game. However, while searching for copies of Greed Island in Yorknew City, he and Killua are sidetracked helping Kurapika fight the criminal Phantom Troupe to avenge his massacred clan. After helping Kurapika seal the Nen powers of Troupe leader Chrollo Lucilfer, Gon and Killua enter Greed Island where they further train under Biscuit Krueger. Gon develops his Hatsu, Ja Jan Ken (ジャジャン拳), a play on "Janken", the Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors.[ch. 207] When Gon throws out "Rock" it enhances his punch, "Scissors" transmutes a sword from his fingers for mid-ranged attacks, and "Paper" emits a ball of aura for long-ranged attacks.

            After he, Killua and Biscuit become the first players to beat Greed Island, Gon returns to the outside world with Killua and reunites with Kite. They soon discover the hostile Chimera Ants, who eat powerful creatures to gain their characteristics. When the Chimera Ant Neferpitou attacks them, Kite covers Gon and Killua's escape and goes missing in action. Gon trains with a group of Hunters to face the Ants, only to be horrified when Kite's body is recovered, reanimated as a puppet by Neferpitou. During the Hunters' raid on Chimera Ant King Meruem's palace, Gon confronts Neferpitou, who pleads for him to wait while they heal a human Meruem had grown fond of. Gon forces them to complete the surgery in as little time as possible and takes them to revive Kite, but Neferpitou reveals that they cannot and declares their intent to kill Gon. Gon is consumed by rage and enters into a Nen Contract to acquire "all the power [he]'ll ever have". This temporarily transforms him into an adult to kill Neferpitou, but leaves him near-death afterward.[ch. 305, 306, 324] After being healed by Alluka Zoldyck's ability, Gon has lost the ability to use Nen as a consequence of his contract.[ch. 333, 334] Gon at last meets Ging, who informs him that Kite has been reincarnated as a Chimera Ant.[ch. 335] A satisfied Gon returns to Whale Island and reunites with Mito.
